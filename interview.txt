Memory management:
Java uses two main areas of memory to manage data: the heap and the stack.

Heap Memory:
	This is where Java stores objects. When you create a new object using the new keyword, it is allocated in the heap.
	Example:	String str = new String("Hello, World!");

Stack Memory:
	This is where Java stores method calls and local variables. Each time a method is called, a new block is created in the stack to hold the method‚Äôs variables and parameters. When the method finishes, this block is removed from the stack.

Garbage Collection uses : 
This helps to prevent memory leaks and allows the program to use memory efficiently.
