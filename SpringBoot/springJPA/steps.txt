1) go to start.spring.io and download the project with dependencies [data JPA, Mysql Driver];
2) in application.properties 
    A] Set up the mysql connect
3) Then Create a modal with Product.java
    A] Give the Class name a annotation of Entity to make the Product Modal JPA Entity 
    B] initialize the column names and give the primarykey a annotation of @Id 
    C] Then Create the Getter and Setter of all the Columns
    D] Learn about the Annotation like Entity, Table, Id, GeneratedValue, Column 
    E] use CreationTimestamp annotation and updatetimestamp annotation for field like created_at and updated_at
    F] ** Implement the Lombok library in pom.xml **
    G] remove all the getter, setter and constructor in the Product Model. and implement the annotation of @Getter, @Setter, @AllArgsConstructor and @NoArgsConstructor
4) Start with the Repository part.
    A] start by creating own interface method
        a] public interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product,Long>{} 
            // in this the Long is the Data type of the Primary Key and Product in the Entity(modal who has this Entity annotation)
    B] we don't need to give @Repository because JpaRepository extends simpleRepository and the simpleRepository file has @Repository so i.e we don't need to put @Repository
    C] once the Repository is created then all the CRUD method is implement in the 'Product'\
    D] We will start with save() method.
        a] as the name depicts, the save() method allow us to save an entity to the DB.
